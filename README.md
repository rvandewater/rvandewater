Hi 👋, I am a PhD student in AI in healthcare at the Hasso Plattner Institute. I am a Computer Scientist and Data Scientist by education. I specialize in using predictive modelling methods to derive insights from healthcare data, thereby prolonging the life of patients. I am interested in applying the most recent ML methods to improve healthcare.
